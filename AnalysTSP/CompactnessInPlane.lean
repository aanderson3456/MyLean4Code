-- Let S be a variable representing a subset of ℝ × ℝ
variable {S : Set (ℝ × ℝ)}

-- The statement "S is compact" is written in Lean as:
-- IsCompact S : Prop

-- This `IsCompact` predicate is defined generally in mathlib for any topological space.
-- For a set S in a topological space α (here α = ℝ × ℝ),
-- `IsCompact S` means that every open cover of S has a finite subcover.
-- Formally (from mathlib, simplified):
-- For T : TopologicalSpace α, IsCompact S :=
--   ∀ {ι : Type u} (U : ι → Set α) (_ : ∀ i, IsOpen (U i)) (_ : S ⊆ ⋃ i, U i),
--     ∃ (t : Finset ι), S ⊆ ⋃ i ∈ t, U i

-- We can check the type of this expression:
#check IsCompact S -- Output: IsCompact S : Prop

In the specific context of ℝ × ℝ (which is a finite-dimensional real vector space,
a metric space, and thus a topological space), the Heine-Borel theorem provides
an equivalent characterization of compactness:

A set S ⊆ ℝ × ℝ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.

Mathlib has this theorem. We can state it using `IsClosed` and `Bornology.IsBounded`:

def IsBounded (s : Set (ℝ × ℝ)) : Prop :=
  ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ x ∈ s, ‖x‖ ≤ C
-- We need more imports for Heine-Borel

  -- This theorem is proven in mathlib for finite dimensional normed spaces over ℝ or ℂ.
  -- ℝ × ℝ is an instance of such a space.

-- So, while the fundamental definition relies on open covers, in ℝ × ℝ,
-- proving `IsCompact S` is often done by proving `IsClosed S` and `Bornology.IsBounded S`.
